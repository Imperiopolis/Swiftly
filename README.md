Swiftly generate autolayout constraints.

## Usage

To run the example project, simply run `pod try swiftly`. Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run the project in the example directory.

All `UIView`s and `UILayoutGuide`s respond to the `applyLayout` method which takes a variadic list of `Swiftly` objects. Convenience initializers are available which pair with all of Apple's `NSLayoutAttribute` types. Common combinatorial layout types `Flush`, `FlushToMargins`, `Vertical`, `Horizontal`, `Center`, and `Size` are also available.

```swift
view.applyLayout(.CenterX(), .Vertical(), .Width() * 0.5)
```

## Installation

Swiftly is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "Swiftly"
```

## Custom Operators

Operators can be used on `Swiftly` objects to produce modified layouts. The `==`, `<=`, `>=`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `~=`, and `/` operators are available.

```swift
view.applyLayout(.CenterX(), .Top() + 20, .Width() * 0.5, .Height() == 200)
```

## Setting Priority

The priority of `Swiftly` objects may be configured.

```swift
view.applyLayout(.CenterY() ~= UILayoutPriorityRequired)
```

## View Relationships

By default, layout types reference the views `superview`. To create a constraint relative to a sibling view pass that view as a paramter.

```swift
view1.applyLayout(.Left() == .Right(view2) + 5, .Size(view2))
```

## Constraint Manipulation

The `applyLayout` method returns an array of the generated `NSLayoutConstraint` objects, which can be used to later to easily disable or modify the generated constraints.

```swift
let constraints = view.applyLayout(.Size() == 5, .Center())
NSLayoutConstraint.deactivateConstraints(constraints)

...

NSLayoutConstraint.activateConstraints(constraints)

```

__Note:__ Any view which has `applyLayout` called on it will automatically set `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` to `false` and have the generated constraints added to its superview.
